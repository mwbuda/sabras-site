	<h2>Coll8: Java-8 compatible enhanced collections</h2>
	<p>
		Coll8 is an in-development library for Java 8+ which provides a number of general purpose helper/utility classes;
		as well as advanced/enhanced data structure & collection types. 
		It is very similar in concept to better known frameworks such as Google Guava or Apache Commons Collections.
		However, unlike Guava or Commons Collections, Coll8 is fully API compatible with Java version 8+
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Coll8 is still in active development; the initial release version should be ready by end of 2015.
		You can take a look at the un-finalized development work at <a href="https://github.com/mwbuda/sabras-coll8">github</a>

	<h2>SwapDMI: Lightweight, Customizable Data Modeling Interface for Ruby</h2>
	<p>
		SwapDMI is a very lightweight, general purpose data layer interface library for Ruby.
		It is intended to be a simple, straightforward framework to help build your own custom data integration code.
		It was originally developed for use cases where ActiveRecord was not a suitable choice for integrating with a remote data source;
		specifically RESTful web services which didn't fully follow pure/HATEOAS conventions. 
		SwapDMI's name comes from it's ability to 'swap-out' multiple implementations of remote data source integration code; 
		developers can use this feature to, for example, mock out a remote web service prior to that remote service being available. 
	</p>
	<p>
		SwapDMI is in active development, but we have several stable releases available at <a href="https://github.com/mwbuda/sabras-swapdmi">github</a>
